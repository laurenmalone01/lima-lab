        <h4>Good UX Design #1</h4>
    
        <p>
          The solution to the problem is to create a calendar/date time popup. This is a very simple fix. It is much easier to simply pick a date while looking on a calendar and input the hours you worked that day.<br>
          As long as the user can see all the days at once, that would be an improvement.
        </p>

        <div>
            <label for="start">Today's date (Current semester):</label>
        <input type="date" id="calendar" name="calendar"
            value="2022-01-01"

            <h4>Good UX Design #2:</h4>
            <p>Even this would be an improvement of what the current timesheet looks like.</p>

                In a perfect world, I would have liked to make this page more interactive. I am not completely satisfied with end product at all. <br>
                I made the decision to only complete some of the requirements for this assignment. But, I truly tried my best in this class, and I hope you could see that through my coursework. As you know, burnout is real. And I hope you do not think less of me because of this. <br><br>
                I figured since I did all of the extra credit assignments, that I would be alright if I did not get an A on this assignment (although, the perfertionist in me says otherwise). I will continue to work on this lab and prepare for CIS 486, as it builds off of this course. 
            </p>I hope you understand. Thanks for teaching my favorite class this semester :)
